# so-docs-tools
Collection of scripts to use the data dump from Stack Overflow's dearly departed Documentation feature.

Pour one out for [Stack Overflow Documentation](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation) and then grab the data dump (coming soon). With a JSON parser in hand, you can use that content wherever your dreams take you. Just be sure to [provide proper attribution](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355115/documentation-is-read-only-what-s-next).

The currently available tools are:

* `save_to_wbm.rb`&mdash;a Ruby script that submits all topics to the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). Demonstrates how to use `doctags.json` and `topics.json`. (I ran it on August 16, 2017 after Documentation was put in readonly mode. There's probably no reason to run it again.)
* Stay tuned for other exciting scripts![^1]

[^1]: Offer contingent on author's creativity and reader's ability to be excited.
